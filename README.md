## *Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel - Spring Song*
### Following her return home, Sakura Matou fuses with the Shadow after killing her brother, Shinji, for his attempted rape. Shirou Emiya finds Shinji's body and is taunted by Zouken Matou for his role in Sakura's corruption, but Shirou is rescued from him by Rider. Afterward, Zouken sends the corrupted Sakura to kidnap Illyasviel von Einzbern - to be a vessel for the Holy Grail like her mother was - and she attacks the Emiya household with Saber Alter; Sakura subdues her sister, Rin Tohsaka, and Illya surrenders to save everyone. Although bound to protect Shirou by Sakura's final command spell, Rider refuses to fight Sakura directly, so Shirou reluctantly asks Kirei Kotomine for help.
